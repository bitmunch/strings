Rental Pots come with all of the things you need to grow any particular plant, plus reduced growing time!\n\nWait a While\nYour plant requires an amount of time to grow. While you wait, you can cast Herbivicus to increase the amount of Potion Ingredients the plant will produce.

    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w1_end_content_00": "The Calamity seems like it might be drawing from a specific moment in time. It feels almost... intentional, in a way we've never seen before.",

    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w1_intro_content_00": "One thing that the Calamity has never had in abundance is precision. At least, until now. We are seeing an uptick in Foundables related to the specific moment in time when Malfoy Manor served as headquarters for Voldemort.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w1_intro_content_01": "The Calamity's focus on this delicate part of our history is highly concerning. We'll sort out the details, but the immediate priority is to return these new Foundables as quickly as possible.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w2_end_content_00": "After thorough review, it appears that all these recent Foundables can be tied directly to 12 Grimmauld Place, the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix -- even that portrait of Phinneas Nigellus Black.  I think I have it!", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w2_end_content_01": "At first, we returned Foundables tied to Voldemort's side of the Second Wizarding War... and then, the Calamity seems to have adapted and presented us with Foundables from the secret hideout of the resistance against him.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w2_end_content_02": "Is the Calamity reacting to our reaction to it? Does that mean that we could theoretically influence it somehow?", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0005_fightingforces_w2_intro_content": "We've seen another turn in the Calamity. The new Foundables we're seeing all seem to be from the same timeframe as those from Malfoy Manor, but otherwise we can't establish a connection...", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_ameliabones_content": "If I'm not mistaken, Madam Bones wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Odd that she would show up here... she did die fighting Voldemort. Maybe that's the connection?", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_brilliant_madeyemoody_content": "Mad-Eye Moody was one of the original members of the Order of the Phoenix -- one of the few that survived to fight Voldemort a second time. So perhaps the Calamity isn't done with the Order yet?",

I hope that Teddy -- that's her son -- doesn't come across this Foundable... I know from personal experience what it's like to interact with a dead parent.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_end_content_00": "If you look at all of the things that we returned, there is one thing in common -- everyone worked directly for the Ministry. Why is the Calamity suddenly focusing on the Ministry?", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_end_content_01": "Could it be that our efforts to combat the Calamity are drawing its attention?",

    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_gethsemaneprickle_content_01": "I can confirm that I didn't die. As for the Order of the Phoenix, I was never invited to join them. But there were other -- and some might say better -- ways to combat the Dark Lord.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_intro_content_00": "The Calamity most recently focused on Grimmauld Place, headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix. It looks like there may well be another surge, and early accounts indicate that it may also be related to the Order.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_intro_content_01": "The Calamity always seems to focus on something in particular -- a time, a place, or a group of people -- if we can identify what the Calamity is targeting, we may be able to figure out how to stop it.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_kingsleyshacklebolt_content": "Interestingly, Kingsley Shacklebolt was a member of the Order, and did his share of fighting... but he's still alive. So I think we can rule out \u201cdeath by Voldemort\u201d as an element of this surge.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w1_rufusscimgeour_content": "Minister Scrimgeour died during the Second Wizarding War, protecting my location from Voldemort. So is the Calamity just... pulling people back who fought against Voldemort?", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_adulthermione_content_00": "If someone at the Ministry had to become a Foundable, it's better, I suppose, for it to be someone who has already come to terms with it. Honestly, it's rather awful.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_adulthermione_content_01": "It doesn't hurt, but you feel a stifling sense of something missing from you and, until it is returned, you cannot put your finger on what it is. I hope you never have to endure it.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_brilliant_arthurweasley_content": "Arthur was a dedicated Ministry employee, but he wasn't exactly famous. It's curious that the Calamity should focus on him.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_constancepickering_content_00": "Now Constance, I don't want you to worry. The effects of being a Foundable are uncomfortable, but as far as we know, there's no long-lasting harm...", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_constancepickering_content_01": "Honestly? It's all a bit flattering, isn't it? All of my hard work has been noticed by the Calamity! I'm absolutely chuffed!", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_dailyprophet_content": "The Daily Prophet seems to turn up as a Foundable often. It's not surprising, given how desperately people await the latest issue for news on the Calamity. Since we haven't been able to do much more than slow it down, I fear they may be waiting a bit longer.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_end_content": "Fortunately, the latest Calamity surge has subsided. Our Ministry employees can stop worrying about becoming Foundables but I have to be honest - these surges frighten me. What if they are just precursors to a larger, more dangerous aspect of the spell?", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_epilouge_end": "You've completed Part Two of this Brilliant Event. Well done! Remember to remain vigilent and keep an eye out for new developments in our fight against the Calamity.",

    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_flyingministrymemos_content": "Sometimes I wonder if the Calamity has a sense of humour. The Ministry is famously bureaucratic, and our critics would no doubt be amused by our memos becoming Foundables.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_intro_content_00": "Harry informed me that the Calamity appears to be focused on the Ministry itself. It's vitally important that you continue returning the Foundables that you find, but I must ask you to be discreet.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_intro_content_01": "The public is looking for the Ministry to be a source of calm. We have no idea what would happen if the Calamity just... whisked us all away at once. I don't think that's possible, but I also would never have imagined anything like was feasible in the first place.", 
    "storyboard_brilliant_0006_strongerunited_w2_percyweasley_content": "Percy is Head of Magical Transportation. It's an important office, but hardly the largest in the Ministry. Why would the Calamity choose him?",

    "storyboard_brilliant_0007_yuleball_brilliant_fred_angelina_content": "After all the stories I've heard of Fred and George Weasleys' antics, I'm surprised that they behaved themselves at the Yule Ball. Seems almost like a missed opportunity for mischief!",
